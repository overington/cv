# Experience

## Dimension Studio, London UK, Nov 2023 -- Present.\
*Software Engineer - Machine Learning and Research* (Nov 2023 - Jun 2025)  
*Senior Software Engineer - Machine Learning and Research* (Jun 2025 - Present)

Applying state-of-the-art machine learning and computer vision research to push the boundaries of virtual production. Key projects include:

__Live human matting project for Omega at Paris Olympic Games 2024__: Developed and deployed an ML-based pipeline for a live activation with 300+ captures/renders per day, enabling audience to virtually race alongside Olympic athletes, captured by 4 cameras. Using machine learning, footage was aligned, segmentated, rendered and uploaded as a user shareable video. The pipeline integrates:

- Pre- and post-processing functions for precise time alignment for use with camera selection, editing, compositing and rendering.
- ML based compositing function removing background from human in video, with moving background (no green-screen) and compositing them onto pre-rendered virtual backgrounds.

__Semantic segmentation and matting pipeline for virtual production__: Leading the development of an automated segmentation pipeline to generate high-quality alpha mattes from raw footage for virtual production. Key achievements:

- Leveraged vision-language models such as BLIP2, GroundingDINO and SAM2 for text-to-object prompting, object detection and segmentation.
- Integrated zero-shot text-to-mask segmentation methods and refined outputs using generative AI models to create precise, production-ready alpha mattes.
- Optimised the output for compositing tools like Nuke and Resolve by creating Cryptomatte files, streamlining the post-production process.

## **Expedia**, London UK, Feb 2022 -- Nov 2023.\
*Machine Learning Engineer* (Growth Marketing & Technology - meta-bidding team) Cross-functional team maintaining & growing big data platform running ML prediction pipelines for meta bidding & business intelligence on AWS infrastructure. I was MLE on several key projects, including:

- Architecting and implementing centralised QA asset, unifying several handcrafted functions performing same algorithm on different platforms.  This was also used as PoC for building out a unified meta-function store, and as the first step in breaking apart our monolithic platform application into modular form
- Migrating legacy code w/ linear process into AirFlow DAGs, enabling step tables, concurrent processing, and code quality improvements

## **Arm**, Cambridge UK, November 2020 -- Jan 2022.\
*Graduate Engineer* (Nov 2020 - Apr 2021)  
*Software Engineer, Machine Learning Group* (Apr 2021 - Jan 2022)

I took part in the arm graduate rotation programme, which exposed me to a variety of different projects and teams within the machine learning group. I chose specific teams and projects to work on to develop my skills in machine learning, computer vision and embedded systems.

- __ML Research team, *Bayesian DeepLearning for CV*__: (2 months) Lead researcher, exploring and implementing Bayesian DeepLearning models for pixel level image segmentation, and optimising for Arm hardware IP.

  - Explore model architectural changes for performance optimisations of DeepLabV3
  - Deep dive into Bayesian DeepLearning methods with a model implementation for pixel segmentation.

- __Applied ML team, *Dynamic hand gesture recognition, and visual wake words*__ (8 months): 
Lead research engineer conducting a literature review of models and datasets, training and optimizing a video understanding model for gesture recognition, and implementing a data generator pipeline using OpenCV for large video datasets. Applying state-of-the-art techniques to enhance performance on low-power, IoT, and embedded Arm IP.

- __ML Tooling Team, *IPSS-ML (IP Selection Sandbox for ML applications)*__ (4 months): Part of the team developing a middle-ware application to simulate and test ML applications on accelerated (NPU) and regular (M/A class processors) Arm IP using fast- and cycle-models.

**Deimos Space UK**, Harwell, Oxfordshire, July -- Sept 2019.  *Computer Vision and Machine Learning research intern* - Built object detection model using neural networks for earth observation data, to detect and differentiate between biodiversity types (Python, TensorFlow and Keras)


**Yobota**, London, Jun -- Sep 2018. *Software Engineer intern* - Developed PoC integration API for OpenBanking using Django / DRF / Oauth 2.0
