Over the course of my undergraduate study so far, my major focus has been on computational, theoretical and mathematical modules; covering calculus, linear algebra, statistics, data analysis and an introduction to group theory. The instrumental modules which have inspired me to pursue AI further in my career, pivot around the areas of computer science and programming; I have built two project using an Arduino; a path-finding robot, using optical and pressure sensors, programming in C++ as well as a temperature sensor, using the change in resistance of a thermal conductor to calculate precise temperatures, and learning about mechanical calibration. Also using C++, I learned about about algorithms and data structures, gaining a deeper understanding how to optimise the structure of a programme with repetitive tasks. Explored numerical methods of scientific computing using python in several modules (each culminating in a final research project), gained skills in statistical data analysis methods and used them to analyse data and create algorithms. I have been part of a team creating a video game in Unity 3D / C# (our team project blog is available at https://fedg-code.github.io/spaceeducation/ ).  My final dissertation subject which explores new and novel methods of calculating scattering amplitudes and Quantum Field Theory.

During the module _Introduction to Scientific Computing_, we used Python and Jupyter Notebooks to model mathematical functions and analyse datasets; extracting relevant physical information from them.  Of particular note, we learned about linear regression algorithms and curve fitting and image manipulation and cleaning using discrete Fourier transform; which drew upon my mathematical knowledge of linear algebra, and calculus.

As my final project for scientific computing, I researched and wrote a scientific report analysing gravitational waves and black hole mergers, which included an analysis of the first confirmed merger.  Utilising the public data-set from the LIGO interferometers, which measure stellar mass black-hole mergers, and python, numpy and scipy, in a Jupyter notebook I analysed the data and I used discrete Fourier transforms to clean the signals, as well as a linear regression to fit Einsteinian prediction about the merger, for example: the mass of each of the two black holes, and producing a 'chirp mass' graph for that particular event.

In first year, I took part in a collaborative group project using Python and MatPlotLib to investigate financial data sourced from the World Bank, collating multiple years of financial information about specific and grouped countries, then analysing and normalising for inflation the results to plot using MatPlotLib's PyPlot, the movement of variables throughout a set time period in specific and grouped countries.
