### 2018 Internship: Fin-tech, and Software engineering.
<!-- The “Hard Sell” Paragraph – Prove how qualified you are. Use bullet points to highlight achievements.  -->

During the 2018 summer break, I undertook a Python software engineering internship with Yobota; a mid-sized fintech startup in London, who have created a lean cloud based banking platform.  I was delegated to the API / integrations team and given the exploratory project of creating an internal client for payment initiations using the UK's new banking initiative the OpenBanking API.  The client that I wrote had to conform to banking industry standards, and employed technologies such as OAuth bearer tokens, a REST API for internal platform use, test driven development life cycle, continuous integration using Jenkins and written using Python / Django / DRF, with testing suite pytest.

As part of team building, I delivered a company presentation on my research into OpenBanking.  And for project planning, I took part in a daily morning standup, and weekly sprint planning meetings, where I set my own goals, and recounted updates on the progress of my integration.
