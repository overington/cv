<!-- ### My interest in IMPROBABLE; -->
<!-- The “Research” Paragraph – Learn about your target company, & explain how you fit into their future. -->
I am interested in how Improbable gaming server platform SpacialOS is innovating how to serve resource intensive tasks, opening a new way in which game and software engineers are able to serve compute intensive tasks, while reducing the resources required to render rich interactive worlds.  This innovation in server architecture has the capacity to impact industries far beyond gaming, and into fields requiring large computing power, but can be segmented, allowing for resource optimisation.

Game development interests me on multiple levels, starting with its inherent ability to push the boundary of simulating physical systems, where I am able to programmatically define the rules of interactive worlds, extending what would normally be physically possible.

I am also interested in game development as a framework to be able to push machine learning, deep neural networks and AI - as has been recently seen for example for the DeepMind's AlphaGo, and more recent AlphaStar.

Working at Improbable, I believe that I would bring unique, out-of-the-box insights from my creative background and analytical skills that would aid a team in imagining and developing the possibilities of the SpacialOS platform.
<!-- ### Personal objective. -->

<!-- Machine learning is, and will continue to be an important aide for scientists and researchers, enabling us to look deeper into data heavy problems.  My software engineering, freelance, and creative experiences, and training in art and science has given me a unique edge in solving problems needed to work in machine learning and AI. I believe that I would bring out-of-the-box insights, making me an ideal candidate for a team undertaking research in machine learning, deep learning and AI. -->
