### Interests
<!-- The “Research” Paragraph – Learn about your target company, & explain how you fit into their future. -->

<!-- I am interested in game development engines as a framework to be able to push machine learning, deep neural networks and AI - as has been recently seen for example for the DeepMind's AlphaGo, and more recent AlphaStar. -->
<!-- I have begun using machine learning techniques in personal projects. One currently that I am working on is a project that will predict outcomes from video input signals, using scikit-learn. -->


I have begun using machine learning techniques in personal projects. One currently that I am working on uses scikit-learn to predict housing prices based on location, and other relevant data-points.


<!-- I am also interested in game engines as a framework for pushing machine learning, deep neural networks and AI - for example DeepMind's AlphaGo, and more recent AlphaStar.  I think that deep learning engines will revolutionise how we process todays data-heavy research. -->

To sum up, I believe that my software engineering, freelance, and training in art and science has given me a unique edge in analysing and solving problems. I believe that I would bring out-of-the-box insights, making me an ideal candidate for your team.
