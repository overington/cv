# Experience

## Dimension Studio, London UK, Nov 2023 -- Present. 

*Software Engineer - Machine Learning and Research*, (Applied Technology
Team)

Applying state-of-the-art machine learning and computer vision research
to push the boundaries of virtual production. Key projects include:

**Live human matting project for Omega at Paris Olympic Games 2024**:
Developed and deployed an advanced ML-based pipeline for live audience
activation. The project enables participants to virtually race alongside
Olympic athletes in real-time, using machine learning for live footage
segmentation and alpha-matting. The pipeline integrates:

-   Pre-processing stage for frame alignment using keyframe finding
    algorithms and timecodes.

-   Deep learning-based encoder-decoder architecture for generating
    alpha-matte layers.

-   Post-processing for seamless integration of live participants into
    pre-rendered virtual backgrounds, resulting in immersive and
    shareable experiences.

**Semantic Segmentation and Matting Pipeline for Virtual Production**:
Leading the development of an automated segmentation workflow that
generates high-quality alpha mattes from raw footage for virtual
production. Key achievements:

-   Leveraged vision-language models such as BLIP2 and GroundingDINO for
    object detection and text-to-object prompting.

-   Integrated zero-shot text-to-mask segmentation methods and refined
    outputs using generative AI models to create precise,
    production-ready alpha mattes.

-   Optimised the output for compositing tools like Nuke and Resolve by
    creating Cryptomatte files, streamlining the post-production
    process.

## **Expedia**, London UK, Feb 2022 -- Nov 2023. 

*Machine Learning Engineer* (Growth Marketing & Technology -
meta-bidding team) Cross-functional team maintaining & growing big data
platform running ML prediction pipelines for meta bidding & business
intelligence on AWS infrastructure. I was MLE on several key projects,
including:

-   Architecting and implementing centralised QA asset, unifying several
    handcrafted functions performing same algorithm on different
    platforms. This was also used as PoC for building out a unified
    meta-function store, and as the first step in breaking apart our
    monolithic platform application into modular form

-   Migrating legacy code w/ linear process into AirFlow DAGs, enabling
    step tables, concurrent processing, and code quality improvements

## **Arm**, Cambridge UK, November 2020 -- Jan 2022. 

*Software Engineer, Machine Learning Group* (Graduate programme)

I took part in the arm graduate rotation programme, which exposed me to
a variety of different projects and teams within the machine learning
group. I chose specific teams and projects to work on to develop my
skills in machine learning, computer vision and embedded systems.

-   **ML Research team, *Bayesian DeepLearning for CV***: (2 months)
    Lead researcher, exploring and implementing Bayesian DeepLearning
    models for pixel level image segmentation, and optimising for Arm
    hardware IP.

    -   Explore model architectural changes for performance
        optimisations of DeepLabV3

    -   Deep dive into Bayesian DeepLearning methods with a model
        implementations for pixel segmentation.

-   **Applied ML team, *Dynamic hand gesture recognition, and visual
    wake words*** (8 months): Lead research engineer conducting a
    literature review of models and datasets, training and optimizing a
    video understanding model for gesture recognition, and implementing
    a data generator pipeline using OpenCV for large video datasets.
    applying state-of-the-art techniques to enhance performance on
    low-power, IoT, and embedded processors Arm IP.

-   **ML Tooling Team, *IPSS-ML (IP Selection Sandbox for ML
    applications)*** (4 months): Part of the team developing a
    middle-ware application to simulate and test ML applications on
    accelerated (NPU) and regular (M/A class processors) Arm IP using
    fast- and cycle-models.

**Deimos Space UK**, Harwell, Oxfordshire, July -- Sept 2019. *Computer
Vision and Machine Learning research intern* - Built object detection
model using neural networks for earth observation data, to detect and
differentiate between biodiversity types (Python, TensorFlow and Keras)

**Yobota**, London, Jun -- Sep 2018. *Software Engineer intern* -
