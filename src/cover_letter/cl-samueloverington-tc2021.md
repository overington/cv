<!-- # SELF INTRODUCTION -->
<!-- The “Intro” Paragraph – Grab the reader’s attention. Introduce yourself, & state why you’re a good fit.  -->
I am a software engineer in the machine learning group at arm, in the Applied Machine Learning - Use Case team.   I am passionate about machine learning and computer vision, and I am searching for a role where I am adapting and applying these technologies and techniques.  I graduated physics from Queen Mary University of London, where my major focus was in theoretical and mathematical modules.  I undertook two internships during this time, one in software development for a fin-tech startup, and the other, as part of the SEPNet programme, as a computer vision and machine learning research intern on the Earth observation team for Deimos Space UK.  Prior to my return to study in 2017, I was working as a freelance web developer, and have a creative background.

To sum up, I believe that my experience in computer vision, machine learning engineering, software development, freelance and my creative background all give me a unique edge in analysing and solving problems in ML. I believe that I would bring out-of-the-box insights, making me an ideal candidate for your team.
