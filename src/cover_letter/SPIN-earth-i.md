# Why are you applying for this project?

I intend on continuing my career in Artificial Intelligence and am looking to further my knowledge by applying for a masters course on the subject. It is because of this that I believe that if I were to be given the opportunity to undertake this internship I would gain a wealth of practical knowledge and understanding in the field by working along side and learning from industry professionals; being under their guidance for the duration of a project, understanding best practices of designing and creating algorithms for neural networks.

I would also like to improve my career prospects, by gaining experience in this area: In the summer of 2019, I undertook a small project working in a similar field; designing algorithms for neural networks in object detection models, preparing training data set and research. I really enjoyed the experience and it made me realise that using machine learning was an area that I wanted to pursue my career in; so I would value this opportunity to hone these skills and knowledge of machine learning and object detection along side industry professionals; gaining a deeper understanding of the workflows involved in extracting rich and useful data from satellite / earth observation data.

# What do you hope to get out of it?

From this internship, I would hope to gain experience and expertise in the following areas:

 - Increase my working knowledge of ML libraries Tensorflow / Keras and other specialist tools used in this field (GDAL)
 - Using machine learning and AI to derive useful information from data sourced from earth observation and satellites.
 - The effects of changing of different resolutions / spectrum channels. So far I have only built object detection models using RGB - I would like to see the effects of using different spectral ranges from satellite sensors and how these effect object detection.
 - Creating object detection model architecture; learning about best practices; how to better test a models accuracy.
 - Deployment of machine learning models in a real world application.
