<!-- ### Interests -->

To sum up, I believe that my software engineering, freelance, and training in art and science has given me a unique edge in analysing and solving problems needed to work in machine learning and AI. I believe that I would bring out-of-the-box insights, making me an ideal candidate for a team undertaking such research.
