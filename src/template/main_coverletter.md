I am a third year undergraduate student in Physics at Queen Mary University of London, with a passion for creativity, science and software engineering.  I have a diverse history of experience with a background in art, where I have been an exhibiting artist working collaboratively with dancers exploring the relationship between drawing, motion and dance.  I have also been a freelance software developer, leading creative front-end web development projects, graphic design. I have recently undertaken two internships:
*   A space engineering company, as part of the earth observation team, where I used python, keras and TensorFlow to create an object detection model, and researching other machine learning and computer vision techniques.
*   A software engineering intern for a fintech startup, and where I used Django to create an OpenBanking service client, and learned about how to build a django web app.
