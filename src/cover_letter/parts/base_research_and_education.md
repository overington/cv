Throughout my degree, I have been learning techniques in mathematics, programming, and physical laws to interrogate, model and analyse data from physical systems.

During the module _Introduction to Scientific Computing_, we used Python and Jupyter Notebooks to model mathematical functions and analyse datasets; extracting relevant physical information from them.  Of particular note, we learned about linear regression algorithms and curve fitting and image manipulation and cleaning using discrete Fourier transform; which drew upon my mathematical knowledge of linear algebra, and calculus.

As my final project for scientific computing, I researched and wrote a scientific report analysing gravitational waves and black hole mergers, which included an analysis of the first confirmed merger.  Utilising the public data-set from the LIGO interferometers, which measure stellar mass black-hole mergers, and python, numpy and scipy, in a Jupyter notebook I analysed the data and I used discrete Fourier transforms to clean the signals, as well as a linear regression to fit Einsteinian prediction about the merger, for example: the mass of each of the two black holes, and producing a 'chirp mass' graph for that particular event.

In first year, I took part in a collaborative group project using Python and MatPlotLib to investigate financial data sourced from the World Bank, collating multiple years of financial information about specific and grouped countries, then analysing and normalising for inflation the results to plot using MatPlotLib's PyPlot, the movement of variables throughout a set time period in specific and grouped countries.
