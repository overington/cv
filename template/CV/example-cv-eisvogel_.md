###  **Expedia**, London UK, Feb 2022.\ {#expedia-london-uk-feb-2022 }
*Machine Learning Engineer* (Meta Marketing Technology Team) Cross-functional team supporting and maintaining a software platform running on AWS
  
  - The platform is built using Airflow, Hive, Python and runs on AWS EMR instances, with Jenkins pipelines for model training and deployment, and DataBricks
  <!-- - Deliver full life-cycle of ML models and data pipelines, productionizing them from a PoC model developed by our ML scientists, to training and QA -->
  - Platform triage support for users located in many time-zones
  - Lead MLE in project migrating legacy project w/ linear process into AirFlow DAGs, enabling step tables, concurrent processing, and code quality improvements
  
###  **Arm**, Cambridge UK, November 2020 -- Jan 2022.\ {#arm-cambridge-uk-november-2020-jan-2022 }
*Software Engineer, Machine Learning Group* (Graduate programme)
  
Taking part in the graduate rotation programme exposed me to a variety of different projects and teams within the machine learning group at arm:
  
- __ML Research team, *Bayesian DeepLearning for CV*__: (2 months) Lead researcher, exploring and implementing Bayesian DeepLearning models for pixel level image segmentation, and optimising for Arm hardware:
  
  - Explore model architectural changes for performance optimisations
  - Based on DeepLabV3 architecture
  - Deep dive into Bayesian DeepLearning methods with a model implementations for pixel segmentation.
  - Model implemented using Keras and TensorFlow
  
- __Applied ML team, *Dynamic hand gesture recognition, and visual wake words*__ (8 months): An ML model for static and dynamic gesture recognition, aimed at low power / IOT / embedded processors
  
  - Lead researcher exploring SOA techniques for dynamic gesture inputs
  - Research and read papers on novel CV ML model architectures and datasets
  - Create data generator pipeline using OpenCV for large video dataset
  - Implement novel architecture aimed at low power processors
  - Report metrics for comparing model accuracy, peak memory usage, FLOPS on base model to compare on a variety of arm hardware IP, and showed changes after model quantisation and other optimisations
  
  
- __ML Tooling Team, *IPSS-ML (IP Selection Sandbox for ML applications)*__ (4 months): a middle-ware application to simulate and test ML applications on accelerated (NPU) and regular (M/A class processors) Arm IP using fast- and cycle-models.
  <!-- - Increase test coverage to all lines of code, adding niche test cases
  - Bring codebase to be completely error and warning free by implement Pylint into CI environment
  - Bug fix front end web app
  - Deliver presentation on methods used to implement Pylint into a live codebase, and Jenkins CI build process with Gerrit -->
