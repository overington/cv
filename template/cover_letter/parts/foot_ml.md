I have begun using machine learning techniques in personal projects. One currently that I am working on is a project that will predict outcomes from video input signals, using scikit-learn.

I am also interested in game engines as a framework for pushing machine learning, deep neural networks and AI - for example DeepMind's AlphaGo, and more recent AlphaStar.  I think that deep learning engines will revolutionise how we process todays data-heavy research.

To sum up, I believe that my software engineering, freelance, and training in art and science has given me a unique edge in analysing and solving problems needed to work in machine learning and AI. I believe that I would bring out-of-the-box insights, making me an ideal candidate for a team undertaking such research.
