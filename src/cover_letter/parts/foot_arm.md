### Future

The way that todays data-heavy research is carried out in academic and industrial settings is presently being revolutionised using machine learning.  At the same time, deep learning techniques such as *convolutional neural networks* are revolutionising machine learning algorithms by generalising or ‘pooling’ localised outputs.

As a prospective intern at Arm, I would be really keen to explore the computer vision and machine learning library *ComputeLibrary*, which is pioneering such techniques, and would be an important aide for scientists and researchers to look deeper into data heavy problems.

My software engineering, freelance, and creative experiences, and training in art and science has given me a unique edge in solving problems needed to work in machine learning and AI. I believe that I would bring out-of-the-box insights, making me an ideal candidate for a team undertaking such research.



<!-- Things to talk about:

role accountabilities:

 - **designing**, **implementing** and **testing** new software libraries for Arm CPUs and GPUs
 - building the software driver for a new Arm neural network accelerator
 - investigating and reporting on trends in computer vision or audio processing, -->

# ARM application notes
#
 - patterns in data are recognised, revolutionising current analytical trends.
 - by using machine learning, deep learning and neural network techniques
 - continue to enhance data analysis methodologies,
 - which will be influential an important aide for scientists and researchers to look deeper into data heavy problems
 - generalising the way in which the way that machine learning *recognises* patterns.
In terms of hardware, ARM-based processors are a majority in the mobile and IoT devices, and being able to process these deep learning techniques on ARM-based hardware therefore

the task of generalising how patterns in data are *recognised* by using machine learning, deep learning and neural network techniques becomes an exciting hurdle that I would like to tackle.  
deal with data-sets, abstracting the principles involved in analysis, revolutionising current trends.
takes large ammounts of compute power, and
I feel that my analytical skills and ... can contribute
I am pursuing a career in which I will be at the forefront of creating the
machine learning algorithms that help those researchers to better understand their data.

<!-- I am interested in how Improbable gaming server platform SpacialOS is innovating how to serve resource intensive tasks, opening a new way in which game and software engineers are able to serve compute intensive tasks, while reducing the resources required to render rich interactive worlds.  This innovation in server architecture has the capacity to impact industries far beyond gaming, and into fields requiring large computing power, but can be segmented, allowing for resource optimisation.

Game development interests me on multiple levels, starting with its inherent ability to push the boundary of simulating physical systems, where I am able to programmatically define the rules of interactive worlds, extending what would normally be physically possible.

I am also interested in game development as a framework to be able to push machine learning, deep neural networks and AI - as has been recently seen for example for the DeepMind's AlphaGo, and more recent AlphaStar.

Working at Improbable, I believe that I would bring unique, out-of-the-box insights from my creative background and analytical skills that would aid a team in imagining and developing the possibilities of the SpacialOS platform. -->
