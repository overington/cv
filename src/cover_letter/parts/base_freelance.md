### Freelance web development experience.

Before commencing my Bsc at Queen Mary, I worked as a freelance web developer, where I used my creative background to design and build custom website themes and plugins, gaining experience in PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS. One such project, which began as full time in 2016, and have continued occasionally helping out with when I commenced my studies; I was lead web developer for *Stillnessinyoga*, a dutch yoga and meditation studio. I built a web platform for their digital learning space and online membership.

which has become an industry leading, online learning space that accompanies their teacher trainings. The site included a content restricted membership area, with e-commerce checkout, and a media streaming platform to present secure video content hosted in a private Amazon S3 buckets.

Along with designing the interactive digital teacher training manuals. I worked along side head teachers to design and put together three teacher training manuals (Level 1, 2, Advanced 2) - in iBook format - an interactive e-publishing book format.
