### Objective

Looking for an internship in software engineering and machine learning,
where I will be able to use my creative background along with my
analytical skills to develop and enhance software projects in a modern
and innovative environment.

### 2008 Software engineering internship. {#software-engineering-internship}

During the 2018 summer break, I undertook a Python software engineering
internship with Yobota; a mid-sized fintech startup in London, who have
created a lean cloud based banking platform. I was delegated to the API
/ integrations team and given the exploratory project of creating an
internal client for payment initiations using the UK's new banking
initiative the OpenBanking API. The client that I wrote had to conform
to banking industry standards, and employed technologies such as OAuth
bearer tokens, a REST API for internal platform use, test driven
development life cycle, continuous integration using Jenkins and written
using Python / Django / DRF, with testing suite pytest.

As part of team building, I gave a company presentation on my research
into OpenBanking. And for project planning, I took part in a daily
morning standup, and weekly sprint planning meetings, where I set my own
goals, and recounted updates on the progress of my integration.

### Research projects and education. {#research-projects-and-education}

Throughout my degree, I have been learning techniques in mathematics,
programming, and physical laws to interrogate, model and analyse data
from physical systems.

During the module *Introduction to Scientific Computing*, we were taught
how to model many mathematical functions and analyse datasets;
extracting relevant physical information from them. Of note, we learned
about linear regression algorithms and curve fitting and image
manipulation and cleaning using discrete Fourier transform; which drew
upon my mathematical knowledge of linear algebra, and calculus.

As my final project for scientific computing, I used the researched and
analysed gravitational waves, using the public data-set from the LIGO
interferometers. Using Fourier transform to clean the signals, and a
linear regression to fit.

In first year, I took part in a collaborative group project using Python
and MatPlotLib to investigate financial data sourced from the World
Bank, collating multiple years of financial information about specific
and grouped countries, then analysing and normalising for inflation the
results to plot using MatPlotLib's PyPlot, the movement of variables
throughout a set time period in specific and grouped countries.

### Freelance web development experience. {#freelance-web-development-experience}

Before commencing my undergraduate study at Queen Mary, I worked as a
freelance web developer, where I used my creative background to design
and build custom website themes and plugins, gaining experience in PHP,
JavaScript, HTML, CSS. This lead to working as the lead developer for
*Stillnessinyoga*, a dutch yoga and meditation studio, where I built
their digital product which has become an industry leading online
learning space to accompany their teacher trainings for students to
become certified yoga and meditation teachers.

I built the online membership e-commerce platform, along with designing
the interactive digital teacher training manuals. I integrated a media
streaming platform to host secure video content, integrating Amazon S3
buckets.
