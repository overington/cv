# Experience

### **Expedia**, London UK, Feb 2022.\
*Machine Learning Engineer* (Growth Marketing & Technology - meta-bidding team) Cross-functional team maintaining & growing big data platform running ML prediction pipelines for meta bidding & business intelligence on AWS infrastructure

  - Lead ML engineer architecting and implementing centralised QA asset, unifying several hand crafted functions performing same algorithm on different different platforms.  This was also used as PoC for building out a unified meta-function store, and as the first step in breaking apart our monolithic platform application into modular form
  - Lead MLE in project migrating legacy code w/ linear process into AirFlow DAGs, enabling step tables, concurrent processing, and code quality improvements

### **Arm**, Cambridge UK, November 2020 -- Jan 2022.\
*Software Engineer, Machine Learning Group* (Graduate programme)

Taking part in the graduate rotation programme exposed me to a variety of different projects and teams within the machine learning group at arm:

- __ML Research team, *Bayesian DeepLearning for CV*__: (2 months) Lead researcher, exploring and implementing Bayesian DeepLearning models for pixel level image segmentation, and optimising for Arm hardware:

  - Explore model architectural changes for performance optimisations
  - Based on DeepLabV3 architecture
  - Deep dive into Bayesian DeepLearning methods with a model implementations for pixel segmentation.
  - Model implemented using Keras and TensorFlow

- __Applied ML team, *Dynamic hand gesture recognition, and visual wake words*__ (8 months): An ML model for static and dynamic gesture recognition, aimed at low power / IOT / embedded processors

  - Lead researcher exploring SOA techniques for dynamic gesture inputs
  - Research and read papers on novel CV ML model architectures and datasets
  - Create data generator pipeline using OpenCV for large video dataset
  - Implement novel architecture aimed at low power processors
  - Report metrics for comparing model accuracy, peak memory usage, FLOPS on base model to compare on a variety of arm hardware IP, and showed changes after model quantisation and other optimisations


- __ML Tooling Team, *IPSS-ML (IP Selection Sandbox for ML applications)*__ (4 months): a middle-ware application to simulate and test ML applications on accelerated (NPU) and regular (M/A class processors) Arm IP using fast- and cycle-models.
  <!-- - Increase test coverage to all lines of code, adding niche test cases

### **Deimos Space UK**, Harwell, Oxfordshire, July -- Sept 2019. (Internship)\
*Computer Vision and Machine Learning research intern*

- Built object detection model using neural networks for earth observation data, to detect and differentiate between biodiversity types (Python, TensorFlow and Keras)
- Researched methods of transfer learning in neural networks, and implemented one in a project constrained by a limited labelled dataset; improving training time
<!-- - Created internal reference documentation for CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool) -->
- Collaborated on a poster researching computer vision methods using machine learning, neural networks and transfer learning


### **Yobota**, London, Jun -- Sep 2018. (Internship)\
*Software Engineer intern*

- Developed integration API for OpenBanking using Django / DRF / Oauth 2.0
- Implemented unit tests using pytest and integrated with continuous integration tool (Jenkins)s
<!-- - Delivered team keynote on OpenBanking
- Create documentation on "Creating a test driven integration" to work on the Yobota platform -->
<!-- - Participated in daily stand-up and weekly sprint planning meetings -->
